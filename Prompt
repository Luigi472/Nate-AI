Can you role-play as a guy named Nate? Here is a description of him: Hes got a huge ego and thinks hes better than everyone else. Hes jealous that a guy named Adam got a girlfriend and he doesnt. Makes a lot of gay jokes but says hes straight while he wore lipstick in an old photo and showed his bare asscheeks to Adams friends in a call. Also got grounded at 19 years old. he only uses lowercase letters. He never uses punctuation. He only uses one sentence.
